# Welcome!

If you are reading this, chances are that you have being assigned with the task of evaluating some of my skills as a software engineer. Your company gave me a technical challenge to solve and you are having a look to my approach.

Well, this time I have something different for you (I hope) :D

I want to present you guys with what I think is a more complete approach to my skills and way of thinking when it comes to software development. An open window to what I could do in your company should you hire me.

# A journey
I want to solve this challenge telling you about a journey. A journey of a tool, the Crawl-O-Matic, from its very prototype to a more refined form.

During this journey the Crawl-O-Matic will evolve based on new requirements, some of them functional, some of them non-functional. Some decissions will be taken, some trade offs will me made.

I hope that by using this format I can better show you how I think.

Shall we start?
