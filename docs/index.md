# Welcome!

If you are reading this, chances are that you have being assigned with the task of evaluating some of my skills as a software engineer. Your company gave me a technical challenge to solve and you are having a look to my approach.

Well, this time I have something different for you (I hope) :grin:

I want to present you guys with what I think is a more complete approach to my skills and way of thinking when it comes to software development. An open window to what I could do in your company should you hire me.

# A journey
I want to solve this challenge telling you about a journey. A journey of a tool, the Crawl-O-Matic, from its very prototype to a more refined form.

During this journey the Crawl-O-Matic will evolve based on new requirements, some of them functional, some of them non-functional. Some decissions will be taken, some trade offs will me made.

I hope that by using this format I can better show you how I think.

Shall we start?

The meeting with Sally went well. After all face to face is the most effective form of communication!

Rodrigo and Sally talked about how the company wants to know more about their customers to be able to offer them targeted solutions.
